# Perceptron-rust-notebook
A perceptron to solve linear equations in rust, on a Jupyter notebook


First install Jupyter Notebook on your device.

* [https://jupyter.org/install](https://jupyter.org/install)

Next, install the evcxr rust kernel for Jupyter

Clone this project

Open Jupyter notebooks, navigate to the download directory and open the file **Perceptron-rust-notebook.ipynb**

Execute each cell of the notebook in sequence. The first one will take a few minutes to install the imports, and the last will take a few seconds to execute the perceptron.
